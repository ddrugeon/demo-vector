      Creating a kind cluster

      This command creates a cluster named 'kind-demo-vector' using the specified configuration file
      'config/kind.yaml'. It ensures that the cluster is created with all the correct parameters and waits for it
      to be ready. It also automatically updates your KUBECONFIG file to include the new cluster entry and sets
      it as the default cluster. By specifying the cluster name, it avoids creating resources on non-local clusters
      that may be configured in your KUBECONFIG file.
